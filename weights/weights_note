Trained networks will appear in this folder as a pickled Python dictionary (.pkl). The naming takes the following format:
# xxxi - number of neurons in the input (i) layer
# xxxxf - number of neurons in the feature (f) layer
# xxxo - number of neurons in the output (o) layer
# X - number of training epochs

Which will look something like - xxxixxxfxxxoX.pkl
An example trained network would be - 784i5488f400o4.pkl
