    "## VPRTempo - Quantized Aware Training and Inferencing Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### By Adam D Hines (https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/people/adam-hines/)\n",

    "[Adam D Hines, Peter G Stratton, Michael Milford, & Tobias Fischer. \"VPRTempo: A Fast Temporally Encoded Spiking Neural Network for Visual Place Recognition. arXiv September 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10225)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods for visual place recognition (VPR) tasks typically employ the use of convolutional neural networks like ResNet to train large datasets for feature extraction of incoming query images, rather than specifically learning said query place. The networks are extremely effective at accurate localisation, but are are slow to train, inference, and store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) by contrast are more energy efficient and have low latency computation, meaning their deployment capability for VPR is extremely promising. Specifically, networks can be trained on the exact location you wish to query which takes a fundamentally different approach to the VPR task.\n",
    "\n",
    "VPRTempo uses a temporal encoding scheme for spikes, where the amplitude of a spike is determined by an incoming training or query image's pixel intensity. This amplitude defines the 'timing' of the spike, similar to a latency code. As spikes propagate throughout the system, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules train neuronal connections based off of the pixel intensity spike amplitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to take the base VPRTempo model to train and inference a network with PyTorch's Quantized Aware Training ([QAT](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html)). Functionally, this tutorial is similar to the previous one as we go through and define the network architecture so if you can skip to **4. Quantization** if you are already familiar with how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: it does not appear that Apple Silicon is currently a supported backend for QAT**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, please ensure you have installed and currently have activated the `conda` environment for VPRTempo."
