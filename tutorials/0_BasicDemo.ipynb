    "This is a basic, extremely simplified version of VPRTempo that highlights how images are transformed, spikes and weights are used, and the readout for performance. Although the proper implementation is in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), we present a simple NumPy example to get started. As in the paper, we will present a simple example using the [Nordland](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~jmfacil/pr-nordland/#download-dataset) dataset with a pre-trained model.\n",

Typically, spikes from image datasets are converted into Poisson spike trains where the pixel intensity determines the number of spikes to propagate throughout a network. VPRTempo only considers each pixel as a single spike, but considers the *amplitude* of the spike to determine the timing within a single timestep - where large amplitudes (high pixel intensity) spike early in a timestep, and vice versa for small amplitudes. \n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have gone through a very basic demo of how VPRTempo takes input images, patch normalizes them, and propagates the spikes throughout the weights to achieve the desired matching output. Although this demonstration was performed using NumPy, the torch implementation is virtually the same except we use tensors with or without quantization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of splitting up excitatory and inhibitory weights is to allow for extra hometostatic normalization of inhibitory connections, which has proven to be critical in regulating overall system activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to go more in-depth with training and inferencing, checkout some of the [other tutorials](https://github.com/AdamDHines/VPRTempo-quant/tree/main/tutorials) which show you how to train your own model and goes through the more sophisticated implementation of VPRTempo."
